          üë• Our app targets two key user groups:
          <br />
          Organizations: Create proposals for their projects or startups and
          seek funding to be raised within a specified period.
          <br />
          Investors: Review these proposals, donate any amount they wish, and in
          return, receive voting power (vPov)
        </p>
        <p>
          üî¢ How vPov Works:
          <br />
          Voting power is calculated at the end of the funding round as:
          Donation Amount / Total Funding
          <br />
          vPov gives investors a say in how their funding is used and allows
          them to vote on subsequent proposals.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          üó≥Ô∏è The Role of vPov:
          <br />
          After the funding is secured, it‚Äôs locked up until the organization
          submits a new proposal to unlock a percentage of the funds.
          <br />
          Investors then vote on these proposals to determine if the funds
          should be released.
        </p>
        <p>
          üíª Powered by Smart Contracts:
          <br />
          Our entire system is driven by smart contracts and can be viewed on
          the blockchain, ensuring a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof
          process for managing and distributing funds.
          <br />
          Looking forward to seeing this project come to life and making a
          significant impact in the crowdfunding space!
